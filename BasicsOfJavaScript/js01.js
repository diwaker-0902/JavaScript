// What is Ecmascript?

// Ecmascript is a standard on which javascript is based.
// It was created to ensure that different documents on js are actually talking about the same language.
// Js & Ecmascript can almost always be used interchangably. Js is very literal in what it allows. 


console.log("Hello World")


//  Variables   : The value of js variables can be changed during the execution of the program.

let a = 44;
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof(a)) // number
console.log()

a = "hii";
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof(a))   // string


// var v/s let

// var is generally scoped while and const are block scoped
// var  can be updated but not re-loaded
// canst can neither be updated nor re-loaded
